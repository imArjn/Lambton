    "### Full Hangman Game Assignment with Hangman Drawing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Build a Hangman game in Python that displays a hangman drawing progressively with each wrong guess. The game should allow a user to guess letters in a secret word, show the guessed letters, and end when the word is guessed or the hangman is fully drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Game Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Secret Word:** Choose a word that the player will guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Display for Guesses:** Show underscores for unguessed letters and reveal letters as they are guessed correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **User Guesses:** Allow the player to input one letter at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check Guesses:** Verify if the guessed letter is in the secret word.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Update Display:** Reveal correctly guessed letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Hangman Drawing:** Create a visual representation of the hangman that progresses with each wrong guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Track Guesses:** Limit the number of wrong guesses (usually 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Game End Conditions:** The game ends when the word is guessed or the hangman is fully drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Repeat the Process:** Use loops to continue the game until an end condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Guide to Drawing the Hangman:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Hangman Stages:** Define a list where each element is a string representing a stage of the hangman. Each wrong guess will reveal the next stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "\n",
    "    hangman_stages = [\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Initial empty stage\n",

    "\n",
    "        # First wrong guess (head)\n",
    "\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "         +---+\n",
    "\n",
    "         |   |\n",

    "             |\n",

    "             |\n",

    "        =========\n",

    "\n",
    "        # Continue adding stages for each body part (body, arms, legs)\n",
    "\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize Hangman Stage:** At the beginning of the game, start with the first stage (empty hangman).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update Hangman Stage on Wrong Guess:** Each time the player guesses incorrectly, move to the next stage of the hangman drawing by indexing into your `hangman_stages` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Print Current Hangman Stage:** After each guess, print the current stage of the hangman."
