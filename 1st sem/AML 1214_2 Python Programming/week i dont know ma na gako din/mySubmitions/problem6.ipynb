    "#### Write a Python class named Time that models the time of day and supports basic time arithmetic such as addition and subtraction. The class should have the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization: The class should have an __init__ method that takes three optional parameters: hour, minute, and second, with default values of 0. These parameters should be stored as instance attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "String Representation: Implement the __str__ method to return the time formatted as a string in the form HH:MM:SS, where HH, MM, and SS are the hour, minute, and second, respectively. Leading zeros should be added to ensure each component has at least two digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Addition: Define the __add__ method to add two Time objects together. The seconds and minutes should overflow correctly (60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour), and the hours should wrap around at 24.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Subtraction: Implement the __sub__ method to subtract one Time object from another. Ensure that the subtraction accounts for the wrap-around of hours and the correct overflow/underflow of minutes and seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, write a main function that takes six parameters representing the hours, minutes, and seconds of two different times (h1, m1, s1 for the first time and h2, m2, s2 for the second). The function should create two Time objects with these parameters, display them, and then print the result of adding the first time to the second and subtracting the first time from the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, demonstrate the functionality of your class and the main function by using a loop to call the main function 10 times with random times generated by the h, m, and s functions, which should return a random hour, minute, and second, respectively."
