    "#### Objective: Create a simple number-guessing game that does the following:\n",
    "       The program generates a random number between 1 and 20 (inclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "       The player has to guess the number with hints provided after each guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "       The game gives feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "       The game ends when the player guesses the correct number.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements:\n",
    "       Use the random module to generate a random number.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Use a while loop to allow the player to keep guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Use if-elif-else statements to check the player's guess and give feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Use the input function to get the player's guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "       The game should tell the player how many guesses they took when they guess correctly.\n",
